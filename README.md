# About this project

This project was based on a previous version of an e-commerce that was created by my workgroup and myself as a final project for Henry bootcamp.

The goal was to create a React app that would be used to create a e-commerce using Tailwind CSS and React for the frontend.

I did this project to practice my frontend skills. 

Redux and Redux Persist were used to handle states and to store the data in local storage.

Backend was created using NodeJS and Express.
PostgreSQL and Sequelize were used to handle the database.
